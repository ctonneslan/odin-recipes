    <h2 class="heading description">Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>
    <h2 class="heading ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This fluffy French toast batter starts with ¼ cup all-purpose flour. </li>
        <li>Milk: Milk adds moisture and richness to the batter. You can substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk if you like. </li>
        <li>Eggs: Of course, you’ll need eggs for French toast! Three eggs bind the batter together and give it a rich texture. </li>
        <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar lends welcome sweetness to this decadent breakfast recipe. </li>
        <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and takes the flavor up a notch. </li>
        <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends coziness and warmth. . </li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make your French toast taste salty: </li>
        <li>Bread: You’ll need 12 slices of your favorite thick-sliced bread. Good choices include brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah.</li>
